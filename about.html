<h1>About Chris Allsman</h1>
<p>Right now, I'm using this website as a hub for my work in college and as a way to organize stuff I make going forward. There's plenty to browse <a href="/projects">here</a>, but feel
free to contact me or check out me shamelessly flaunting my qualifications below!</p>

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>I received a BA in Computer Science with High Distinction from UC Berkeley in 2019. While in school, my primary focuses were Computational Biology and Programming Languages, 
            although I also explored a bit of Machine Learning and Systems Programming. While these remain my primary interests, I'm always trying to explore new areas!</p>
            <p>I mainly use Python and Go for my day-to-day programming, and used Scheme extensively in my academic work. 
            However, my largest projects were written in C, C++, and Java, so I feel quite comfortable using them.
            I've also dabbled in OCaml, Ruby, Prolog, and C#.</p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>From 2017-2019, I was a TA for <a href="https://cs61a.org/">CS 61A</a> at UC Berkeley, which is the first computer science course most students take. 
            For my final two semesters, I was a head TA responsible for developing and managing content, including homework, labs, discussion handouts, and a
            <a href="/projects/typing-speed-test">new project</a>, recognized as a Nifty Assignment at SIGSCE 2020.
            Additionally, I was recognized as an Outstanding GSI and received an award for Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching and Leadership.</p>
         <p>After I graduated, I was an instructor for CS61A during the <a href="https://su19.cs61a.org/">Summer 2019 semester.</a> In addition to giving lectures and managing logistics for over 600 
         students, I also developed the first online offering of the course. In my course evaluations, I was given a teaching effectiveness rating of 6.2/7, which 
         <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/course/CS/61A">meets or exceeds</a> the effectiveness of other long-term professors that taught the course.</p>
         <p>In addition to my positions on course staff, I was involved with <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/">Computer Science Mentors</a>, an organization which attempts to reduce the barrier to entry for students interested in declaring Computer Science by offering small group tutoring and other resources. I was a mentor for 6 semesters,
         as well as a CS 61A course coordinator for 2 semesters and the Internal Vice President for 1 semester. In these roles, I was responsible for organizing content and logistics,
     but also introduced new training and initiatives related to mental health and addressing unconscious bias. </p>
